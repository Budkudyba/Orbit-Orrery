# Orbit-Orrery
This is an old project in which I experimented with DirectX10 to produce a simulation of the solar system. Not unlike a digital orrery.  

The code takes as input a planets: Rotation, Acceleration, Mass, Radius, Inclination, Logitude of ascending node, eccentricity, periapsis, simiMajor Axis, meanAnomaly, meanMotion, and meanLongitude to compute a planet's orbit.
  
The code is based off of some example work of Frank D. Luna, and his book Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 10.
