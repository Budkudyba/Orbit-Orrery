# Orbit-Orrery
This is an old project experimenting with DirectX10 to produce a simulation of the solar system. Not unlike a digital orrery.  

The code takes as input a planets: Rotation, Acceleration, Mass, Radius, Inclination, Logitude of ascending node, eccentricity, periapsis, simiMajor Axis, meanAnomaly, meanMotion, and meanLongitude to compute a planet's orbit.
  
The code is based off of some example work of Frank D. Luna, and his book Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 10.  

The VSP file is removed due to size.
